# DOCUMENTATION
## Task 1
### OpenCV

> 1. Install OpenCV.
> - pip install opencv-python
> 2. Run OpenCV to access camera.

### Resources Learnt
#### Computer Vision

Computer Vision, often abbreviated as CV, is defined as a field of study that seeks to develop techniques to help computers “see” and understand the content of digital images such as photographs and videos.Typically, this involves developing methods that attempt to reproduce the capability of human vision.

#### OpenCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms. These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, stitch images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene,etc. [Learn More.](https://opencv.org/about/)

#### IDLE

IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Python. The Python installer for Windows contains the IDLE module by default. [Learn More](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-idle)

### Steps Taken

> 1. Install python([click here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)). _pip_ is already installed in the system with python installation.
> 2. Open the Command Prompt and write the command __pip install opencv-python__ in it to install OpenCV.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3AT9EGp4iw) 
> 3. Open _IDLE_, create a new file and write the code to access the camera using OpenCV-python.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvf5y21ZqtQ)

## Task 2
### Git and Github

> 1. Learn Git and Github.
> 2. Write documentation of all the learnings in markdown format.

### Resources Learnt 
#### Git and Github

Git is a distributed version control tool that can manage a development project's source code history, while GitHub is an online service that stores code pushed to it from computers running the Git tool.[![GIT AND GITHUB](http://img.youtube.com/vi/watch?v=WbwIoQYP6no/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbwIoQYP6no)
