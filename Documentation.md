## Resources Learnt
#### Computer Vision

Computer Vision, often abbreviated as CV, is defined as a field of study that seeks to develop techniques to help computers “see” and understand the content of digital images such as photographs and videos.Typically, this involves developing methods that attempt to reproduce the capability of human vision.

#### OpenCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms. These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, stitch images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene,etc. [Learn More.](https://opencv.org/about/)
